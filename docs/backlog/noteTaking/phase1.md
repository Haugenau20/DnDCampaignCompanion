# Phase 1: Project Overview

## Note-Taking Feature Overview

### Purpose
Create an integrated note-taking system for D&D campaign companions that:
- Captures session notes during gameplay
- Extracts entities (NPCs, locations, etc.) from notes
- Converts notes into structured campaign elements
- Maintains history and relationships with campaign data

### Feature Requirements
1. Session-based note organization
2. Real-time note editing during sessions
3. Entity extraction from freeform text
4. One-click conversion to campaign elements
5. Note-to-entity relationship tracking
6. Session history and timeline view

### Technical Architecture
The feature will integrate with existing systems:
- **Data Layer**: Firebase for note storage
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks
- **UI Components**: Theme-compliant React components
- **Entity Extraction**: OpenAI API integration

### Implementation Phases
1. Project Overview & Planning (This Phase)
2. Data Model & Schema Design
3. Context & State Management Setup
4. Hook Development
5. UI Component Development
6. Session Flow Implementation
7. Entity Extraction Integration
8. Campaign Integration
9. Testing & Validation

### Deliverables
- Fully functional note-taking system
- Entity extraction pipeline
- Integration with existing campaign elements
- Complete test coverage

### Success Criteria
- Users can take notes during D&D sessions
- Notes can be converted to NPCs, locations, etc.
- Session notes are organized chronologically
- Performance remains within acceptable bounds
- All theme requirements are met

### Next Steps
Proceed to Phase 2: Data Model & Schema Design

## Dependencies
- React (existing)
- Firebase (existing)  
- OpenAI API (new)
- TypeScript (existing)
- Existing component library


Here's the complete design and implementation guide for your note-taking feature with OpenAI integration:

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Create new session notes
- [ ] Edit session notes with autosave
- [ ] Extract entities from notes using OpenAI
- [ ] Convert entities to campaign elements
- [ ] Link notes to existing entities
- [ ] View timeline of sessions
- [ ] Search through session notes

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Verify note-entity relationships
- [ ] Check cross-references between campaign elements
- [ ] Test multi-user collaboration
- [ ] Validate data consistency

### UI/UX Tests
- [ ] Theme compliance across all components
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility features
- [ ] Loading states and error handling

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Network disconnection during note creation
- [ ] OpenAI API failures/rate limiting
- [ ] Invalid API key handling
- [ ] Attempted duplicate entity creation
- [ ] Invalid note IDs
- [ ] Permission errors

## Performance Considerations

1. **Debounce Implementation**
   - Note content autosave
   - Entity extraction requests

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Session note list pagination
   - Entity extraction results

3. **Caching**
   - Recently viewed notes
   - Extracted entities

## Final Validation

Before deployment, ensure:
1. All tests pass
2. No console errors or warnings
3. Theme compliance maintained
4. Performance within acceptable limits
5. Accessibility requirements met
6. Cross-browser compatibility verified
7. OpenAI API integration working correctly
8. Usage tracking functioning properly

## Conclusion

The note-taking feature implementation is complete with:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Performance optimizations
- UI/UX polish
- Full integration with campaign system
- OpenAI-powered entity extraction

The feature is ready for deployment and provides a seamless experience for capturing and organizing D&D campaign information.
