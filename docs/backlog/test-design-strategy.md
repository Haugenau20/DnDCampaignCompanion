# Test Design Strategy
## Business Logic & Data Flow Testing Before Restructuring

*Strategy Document: June 14 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive test design strategy focused on critical business logic and data flow before undertaking major codebase restructuring. The strategy prioritizes campaign entity management, note-taking functionality, and user/group management while addressing known issues identified in the current system.

**Testing Philosophy**: Test the business behavior that users depend on, not implementation details. Focus on data integrity, cross-feature relationships, and critical user workflows.

**Firebase Strategy**: Leverage existing Firebase emulators for integration testing while using selective mocking for unit tests.

---

## Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Design

### **Firebase Emulator Integration Strategy**

**Decision**: Use Firebase emulators for integration tests, mocks for isolated unit tests.

**Rationale**: 
- You already have emulators running - leverage existing infrastructure
- Emulator tests catch Firebase-specific issues (security rules, data structure validation)
- Mocks allow faster, isolated testing of business logic
- Hybrid approach provides both speed and confidence

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Unit Tests**: Mock Firebase for fast, isolated logic testing
- **Integration Tests**: Use emulators for data flow and relationship testing
- **Workflow Tests**: Use emulators for complete user journey testing

### **Test Environment Setup Design**

**Test Categories**:
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual context methods (create, read, update, delete)
2. **Integration Tests**: Cross-feature interactions using emulators
3. **Workflow Tests**: Complete user scenarios using emulators
4. **Data Integrity Tests**: Relationship consistency using emulators

**Test Data Strategy**:
- **Isolated Test Data**: Each test creates and cleans up its own data
- **Realistic Relationships**: Test data mirrors actual campaign complexity
- **Edge Case Data**: Include boundary conditions and malformed data
- **Performance Data**: Large datasets for load testing

## Phase 2: Campaign Entity Management Testing

### **Priority 1: Core Entity CRUD Operations**

**What to Test**:
- **NPCContext Operations**: Create, read, update, delete NPC entities
- **QuestContext Operations**: Complete quest lifecycle management

- **Update**: Modify NPC properties without breaking relationships
- **Deletion**: Remove NPC while cleaning up quest/location references
- **Bulk Operations**: Handle multiple NPCs efficiently (addresses todo item #10)
- **Performance**: Load time optimization (addresses todo: "NPCs Page seems to take longer to load")

#### **Quest Testing Focus**:
- **Status Management**: Active, pending, completed quest transitions
- **Priority Sorting**: Active quests appear first (addresses todo item #8)
- **Visibility Control**: Completed quest hiding/showing (addresses todo item #9)
