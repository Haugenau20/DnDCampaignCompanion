## Target Architecture Overview

### **Final Structure Vision**
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── campaign-entities/     # NPCs, Quests, Locations, Rumors
│   ├── storytelling/         # Chapters, Stories, Timeline
│   ├── collaboration/        # Notes, Sessions, Real-time
│   └── user-management/      # Auth, Groups, Profiles
├── shared/                   # Cross-domain shared
├── core/                     # Infrastructure
├── pages/                    # Route definitions (thin)
└── app/                      # App setup and providers
```

### **Key Principles**
1. **Feature Ownership**: Each feature contains all its related code
2. **Domain Cohesion**: Related features grouped by business purpose
3. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common code properly abstracted
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Enforced import rules and dependencies
5. **Public APIs**: Features expose clean interfaces

---

## Pre-Migration Prerequisites

### **Phase 0: Foundation Preparation (Week 1)**

#### **Step 0.1: Complete Testing Implementation**
**What**: Implement the comprehensive testing strategy before beginning restructuring.

**Why**: Tests serve as your safety net and regression detection system.

**Success Criteria**:
- All critical business logic covered by tests
- Tests passing consistently
- Test suite runs in under 5 minutes
- Firebase emulator integration working

#### **Step 0.2: Create Migration Branch Strategy**
**What**: Establish branch structure for safe experimentation.

**Approach**:
- **Main Branch**: Keep stable throughout migration
- **Feature Migration Branches**: One per domain being migrated
- **Integration Branch**: Combine migrated features for testing

**Branch Naming Convention**:
- `migration/campaign-entities`
- `migration/storytelling`
- `migration/collaboration`
- `migration/user-management`

#### **Step 0.3: Document Current Dependencies**
**What**: Map all current cross-feature dependencies before breaking them.

**Documentation Needed**:
- Context import mappings (which components import which contexts)
- Service usage patterns (how Firebase services are consumed)
- Type sharing patterns (which types are used across features)
- Hook dependencies (which hooks depend on which contexts)

**Tools for Discovery**:
- IDE dependency analysis
- TypeScript compiler dependency graphs
- Manual audit of import statements

#### **Step 0.4: Establish Architectural Rules**
**What**: Define and document the rules for the new architecture.

**Import Rules**:
- Features can import from `shared/` and `core/`
- Features cannot import from other features directly
- Domain-level sharing only within domain boundaries
- Page components import from feature public APIs only

**Dependency Rules**:
- One-way dependency flow: app → features → shared → core
- No circular dependencies between features
- Shared services accessible to all features
- Core infrastructure independent of business logic

---

## Migration Strategy Overview

### **Migration Approach: Domain-by-Domain**

**Why Domain-by-Domain**:
- **Manageable Scope**: Each domain is a self-contained unit of work
- **Business Logic Cohesion**: Features that work together migrate together
- **Risk Isolation**: Problems in one domain don't affect others
- **Parallel Development**: Can work on multiple domains simultaneously

**Migration Order Priority**:
1. **Campaign Entities**: Core business domain, most interconnected
2. **User Management**: Foundation for other features
3. **Collaboration**: Notes and sessions functionality
4. **Storytelling**: Chapters and story management

### **Migration Phases Per Domain**

#### **Phase Pattern for Each Domain**:
1. **Preparation**: Set up new structure, move files
2. **Internal Restructuring**: Organize feature internals
3. **Shared Extraction**: Move shared code to domain shared
4. **Public API Creation**: Establish feature interfaces
5. **Dependency Cleanup**: Remove external dependencies
6. **Integration Testing**: Verify everything works
7. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to main branch

## Domain 1: Campaign Entities Migration (Weeks 2-4)

### **Week 2: Campaign Entities Foundation**

#### **Step 1.1: Create Domain Structure**
**What**: Establish the physical directory structure for campaign entities.

**Actions**:
- Create `src/features/campaign-entities/` directory
- Create subdirectories: `npcs/`, `quests/`, `locations/`, `rumors/`, `shared/`
- Set up `index.ts` files for public API exports
- Create initial TypeScript barrel exports

**Validation Criteria**:
- Directory structure matches target architecture
- All subdirectories have proper index files
- TypeScript compilation still works
- No functionality changed

#### **Step 1.2: Move Feature Files**
**What**: Relocate all files related to campaign entities without changing imports yet.

**NPC Feature Files to Move**:
- Components: `src/components/features/npcs/*` → `src/features/campaign-entities/npcs/components/`
- Pages: `src/pages/npcs/*` → `src/features/campaign-entities/npcs/pages/`
- Types: `src/types/npc.ts` → `src/features/campaign-entities/npcs/types/`

**Similar Moves for**:
- Quest feature files
- Location feature files
- Rumor feature files

**Import Update Strategy**:
- Use IDE refactoring tools for bulk import updates
- Update one feature at a time to isolate issues
- Test after each feature move

#### **Step 1.3: Move Feature Contexts**
**What**: Relocate context files into their respective feature directories.

**Context Migrations**:
- `src/context/NPCContext.tsx` → `src/features/campaign-entities/npcs/context/`
- `src/context/QuestContext.tsx` → `src/features/campaign-entities/quests/context/`
- `src/context/LocationContext.tsx` → `src/features/campaign-entities/locations/context/`
- `src/context/RumorContext.tsx` → `src/features/campaign-entities/rumors/context/`

**Provider Integration Considerations**:
- Update App.tsx provider imports
- Maintain provider nesting order
- Test context functionality after each move

### **Week 3: Internal Feature Organization**

#### **Step 2.1: Move Feature-Specific Hooks**
**What**: Relocate hooks that are specific to individual features.

**Hook Migrations**:
- `src/hooks/useNPCData.ts` → `src/features/campaign-entities/npcs/hooks/`
- Similar for quest, location, rumor-specific hooks

**Shared Hook Identification**:
- `useFirebaseData`: Likely stays in shared
- `useSearch`: Cross-domain, moves to shared
- `useNavigation`: App-wide, stays in shared

#### **Step 2.2: Create Feature Public APIs**
**What**: Establish clean interfaces for each feature.

**NPC Feature Public API Design**:
```typescript
// src/features/campaign-entities/npcs/index.ts
export { NPCProvider } from './context/NPCContext';
export { useNPCs } from './hooks/useNPCData';
export { NPCCard, NPCDirectory, NPCForm } from './components';
export { NPCsPage, NPCCreatePage, NPCEditPage } from './pages';
export type { NPC, NPCFormData } from './types';
```

**API Design Principles**:
- Export only what other parts of the app need
- Hide internal implementation details
- Provide stable interfaces that won't change frequently
- Group exports logically (components, hooks, types, pages)

#### **Step 2.3: Identify Shared Domain Logic**
**What**: Find code that's shared across campaign entities but not the whole app.

**Candidates for Domain Shared**:
- **Relationship Management**: Code that handles NPC ↔ Quest ↔ Location relationships
- **Entity Search**: Search logic specific to campaign entities
- **Common Components**: Components used by multiple entity types
- **Shared Types**: Types used across multiple entity features

**Analysis Questions**:
- Is this code used by multiple campaign entity features?
- Is this code specific to campaign management vs. other domains?
- Would other domains (storytelling, collaboration) need this code?

### **Week 4: Relationship Refactoring**

#### **Step 3.1: Create Relationship Service**
**What**: Build a centralized service for managing entity relationships.

**Why Needed**: Current cross-context dependencies need to be abstracted.

**Service Responsibilities**:
- **Link Entities**: Create relationships between NPCs, quests, locations
- **Unlink Entities**: Remove relationships safely
- **Query Relationships**: Find related entities efficiently
- **Cascade Operations**: Handle deletion cascading

**Service Location**: `src/features/campaign-entities/shared/services/EntityRelationshipService.ts`

#### **Step 3.2: Extract Cross-Feature Components**
**What**: Move components used by multiple entity types to domain shared.

**Candidates for Shared Components**:
- **EntityCard**: Generic card component for any entity type
- **EntityMention**: Component for mentioning entities in text
- **RelationshipDisplay**: Show relationships between entities
- **EntitySelector**: Select entities for relationships

**Shared Component Location**: `src/features/campaign-entities/shared/components/`

#### **Step 3.3: Remove Cross-Feature Context Dependencies**
**What**: Replace direct context imports with relationship service usage.

**Current Problem Pattern**:
```typescript
// Bad: NPCCard directly imports QuestContext
const { getQuestById } = useQuests();
```

**New Pattern**:
```typescript
// Good: Use relationship service
const relationshipService = useEntityRelationships();
const relatedQuests = relationshipService.getRelatedEntities('npc', npcId, 'quest');
```

**Migration Steps**:
1. Update one component at a time
2. Test each component change individually
3. Remove unused context imports
4. Verify no cross-feature context dependencies remain

#### **Step 3.4: Campaign Entities Integration Testing**
**What**: Verify the migrated campaign entities domain works correctly.

**Testing Focus**:
- All CRUD operations still work
- Entity relationships function correctly
- Search across entity types works
- No performance regressions
- Public APIs provide needed functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing tests pass
- New relationship service tests pass
- Application functionality unchanged from user perspective
- No imports violate new architectural rules
