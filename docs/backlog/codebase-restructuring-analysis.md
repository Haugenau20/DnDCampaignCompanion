# Codebase Restructuring Analysis
## D&D Campaign Companion - Architectural Redesign Recommendations

*Analysis Date: June 14 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

After deep analysis of the current codebase architecture, I've identified significant organizational challenges that create high cognitive load and tight coupling between features. This document presents multiple restructuring approaches, analyzes their trade-offs, and provides concrete recommendations for improving code organization, maintainability, and developer experience.

**Key Finding**: The current **functional/technical architecture** forces developers to navigate 6+ directories to work on a single feature, creating unnecessary complexity and tight coupling.

**Recommended Solution**: **Hybrid Feature-First Architecture** with clear domain boundaries and shared infrastructure.

---

## Current Architecture Problems

### 🚨 **High Cognitive Load**
When working on the NPC feature, developers must navigate:
- `/src/context/NPCContext.tsx` - State management
- `/src/hooks/useNPCData.ts` - Data fetching logic  
- `/src/types/npc.ts` - Type definitions
- `/src/components/features/npcs/` - UI components (5-6 files)
- `/src/pages/npcs/` - Page components (3 files)
- `/src/services/firebase/data/` - Generic data services

**Total: 6+ different directories for a single feature**

### 🕸️ **Tight Coupling Web**
- NPCCard imports from QuestContext, NavigationContext, NPCContext
- QuestCard imports from NPCContext, LocationContext, NavigationContext
- SearchContext depends on ALL feature contexts
- Features routinely cross-reference each other's data

### 📂 **Scattered Feature Logic**
```typescript
// Current: Logic scattered across multiple directories
import { useNPCs } from '../../../context/NPCContext';
import { useQuests } from '../../../context/QuestContext';
import { NPC } from '../../../types/npc';
import { NPCService } from '../../../services/firebase/data/DocumentService';
```

### 🏗️ **Inconsistent Abstraction Levels**
- Some hooks are feature-specific (`useNPCData`)
- Others are generic utilities (`useFirebaseData`)  
- No clear boundaries between shared and specific logic

## Architectural Approach Evaluation

### **Approach 1: Pure Feature-Centric Architecture**

#### Structure
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── npcs/
│   │   ├── components/     # NPCCard, NPCForm, NPCDirectory
│   │   ├── hooks/         # useNPCData, useNPCForm, useNPCRelations
│   │   ├── context/       # NPCContext, NPCProvider
│   │   ├── services/      # NPCService, NPCRelationshipService
│   │   ├── types/         # npc.ts, npc-relations.ts
│   │   ├── pages/         # NPCsPage, NPCCreatePage, NPCEditPage
│   │   ├── utils/         # NPC-specific utilities
│   │   └── index.ts       # Public API exports
│   ├── quests/
│   ├── locations/
│   ├── rumors/
│   ├── stories/
│   └── notes/
├── shared/
│   ├── components/        # Truly shared UI components
│   ├── hooks/            # Cross-cutting hooks
│   ├── contexts/         # Application-wide contexts
│   ├── services/         # Shared business services
│   └── utils/            # Shared utilities
├── core/
│   ├── components/       # Button, Input, Card (UI primitives)
│   ├── services/         # Firebase, Auth (infrastructure)
│   ├── types/            # Common type definitions
│   └── config/           # App configuration
└── infrastructure/
    ├── routing/          # Route definitions
    ├── providers/        # Root provider setup
    └── theme/            # Theme configuration
```

#### Pros
✅ **Extreme clarity**: Everything for NPCs in one place  
✅ **Easy feature extraction**: Can easily extract a feature into a separate package  
✅ **Reduced cognitive load**: Only need to navigate one directory per feature  
✅ **Clear ownership**: Each feature owns its complete logic  
✅ **Easier testing**: Can test features in complete isolation  

#### Cons
❌ **Potential duplication**: Similar logic might be repeated across features  
❌ **Relationship complexity**: Hard to manage cross-feature relationships  
❌ **Over-isolation**: Might create artificial boundaries where integration is natural  
❌ **Bundle size**: Each feature loads its own copies of similar logic  

#### **Suitability for D&D Companion: 6/10**
*While this reduces cognitive load, the high interconnection between D&D entities (NPCs ↔ Quests ↔ Locations) makes pure isolation problematic.*

### **Approach 2: Domain-Driven Design Architecture**

#### Structure
```
src/
├── domains/
│   ├── campaign-management/
│   │   ├── features/
│   │   │   ├── npcs/
│   │   │   ├── locations/
│   │   │   ├── quests/
│   │   │   └── rumors/
│   │   ├── shared/
│   │   │   ├── components/    # Campaign-specific UI
│   │   │   ├── hooks/         # Cross-entity hooks
│   │   │   ├── services/      # CampaignService, RelationshipService
│   │   │   └── types/         # Shared campaign types
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── storytelling/
│   │   ├── features/
│   │   │   ├── chapters/
│   │   │   ├── stories/
│   │   │   └── timeline/
│   │   ├── shared/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── collaboration/
│   │   ├── features/
│   │   │   ├── notes/
│   │   │   ├── sessions/
│   │   │   └── sharing/
│   │   └── shared/
│   └── user-management/
│       ├── features/
│       │   ├── auth/
│       │   ├── groups/
│       │   └── profiles/
│       └── shared/
├── shared/              # Cross-domain shared code
├── core/               # Infrastructure
└── infrastructure/
```

#### Pros
✅ **Business context clarity**: Features grouped by business purpose  
✅ **Domain-specific sharing**: Can share logic within business domains  
✅ **Scalable**: Works well as the application grows  
✅ **Natural boundaries**: Aligns with how users think about the app  
✅ **Reduced coupling**: Clear interfaces between domains  

#### Cons
❌ **Complexity**: More complex directory structure  
❌ **Domain boundary decisions**: Requires clear understanding of business domains  
❌ **Cross-domain dependencies**: Still need to manage relationships between domains  
❌ **Migration complexity**: Harder to migrate from current structure  

#### **Suitability for D&D Companion: 8/10**
*Excellent fit for the business model - clear separation between campaign management, storytelling, and collaboration concerns.*

### **Approach 3: Enhanced Layered Architecture**

#### Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── providers/        # Root providers and context setup
│   ├── router/          # Application routing configuration
│   └── config/          # App-wide configuration
├── pages/               # Route components (thin, composition-focused)
├── features/            # Business feature modules
│   ├── campaign-entities/
│   ├── storytelling/
│   ├── collaboration/
│   └── user-management/
├── shared/              # Cross-feature shared logic
│   ├── components/      # Shared business components
│   ├── hooks/          # Cross-cutting hooks
│   ├── services/       # Shared business services
│   ├── contexts/       # App-wide contexts
│   └── types/          # Shared type definitions
├── core/               # Infrastructure and UI primitives
│   ├── components/     # Button, Input, Card
│   ├── services/       # Firebase, Auth services
│   ├── hooks/          # Infrastructure hooks
│   └── types/          # Core type definitions
└── utils/              # Pure utility functions
```

#### Dependency Rules
```
app/        → features/, shared/, core/
pages/      → features/, shared/, core/
features/   → shared/, core/ (NOT other features/)
shared/     → core/
core/       → (no internal dependencies)
utils/      → (no dependencies)
```

#### Pros
✅ **Clear dependency rules**: Enforced architectural boundaries  
✅ **Familiar structure**: Similar to current but with better rules  
✅ **Gradual migration**: Can migrate incrementally  
✅ **Tool support**: Many tools understand layered architectures  

#### Cons
❌ **Still scattered**: Feature logic still spread across layers  
❌ **Cognitive load**: Still need to navigate multiple directories  
❌ **Artificial boundaries**: Some boundaries might feel forced  

#### **Suitability for D&D Companion: 5/10**
*Improves current structure but doesn't solve the core cognitive load problem.*

├── utils/                    # Pure utilities
└── app/                      # App setup and providers
```

#### Key Principles

1. **Features Own Their Logic**: All NPC-related code lives in `/features/campaign-entities/npcs/`
2. **Domain-Level Sharing**: Campaign entities share common relationship logic
3. **Clear Public APIs**: Each feature exports a clean public interface
4. **Dependency Rules**: Features can only import from shared/ and core/, never from other features
5. **Shared Infrastructure**: Firebase, Auth, UI components are truly shared

#### Import Examples
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Feature imports from its own directory
import { NPCCard } from './components/NPCCard';
import { useNPCData } from './hooks/useNPCData';

// ✅ Good: Feature imports from domain shared
import { useEntityRelations } from '../shared/hooks/useEntityRelations';
import { EntityMention } from '../shared/components/EntityMention';

// ✅ Good: Feature imports from core infrastructure
import { Button } from '../../../core/components/Button';
import { useFirebase } from '../../../core/services/FirebaseService';

// ❌ Bad: Direct cross-feature imports
import { useQuestData } from '../../quests/hooks/useQuestData';
```

#### Cross-Feature Communication
```typescript
// Instead of direct imports, use shared relationship service
const relationshipService = useEntityRelationshipService();

// Get related entities through the service
const relatedQuests = relationshipService.getRelatedEntities('npc', npcId, 'quest');
const relatedLocations = relationshipService.getRelatedEntities('quest', questId, 'location');
```

#### Pros
✅ **Reduced cognitive load**: Everything for NPCs in one place  
✅ **Domain context**: Related features grouped together  
✅ **Managed relationships**: Clear system for cross-feature dependencies  
✅ **Incremental migration**: Can migrate one feature at a time  
✅ **Scaling friendly**: Structure supports growth  
✅ **Testing isolation**: Can test features independently  
✅ **Clear boundaries**: Features have explicit public APIs  

#### Cons
❌ **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand new patterns  
❌ **Migration effort**: Significant refactoring required  
❌ **Relationship service complexity**: Need to build relationship management  

#### **Suitability for D&D Companion: 9/10**
*Optimal balance of feature clarity, domain organization, and manageable complexity.*

## Conclusion

The **Hybrid Feature-First Architecture** represents the optimal balance for the D&D Campaign Companion. It addresses the core problems of high cognitive load and tight coupling while respecting the interconnected nature of campaign entities.

This approach will:
- **Dramatically reduce** the cognitive load of working on features
- **Improve** code organization and maintainability
- **Enable** better testing and development practices
- **Support** future growth and feature additions
- **Maintain** the collaborative, interconnected nature of D&D campaigns

The migration can be done incrementally with minimal risk, and the benefits will be immediately apparent as each feature is migrated to its new home.

**Next Steps:**
1. Gain team consensus on the approach
2. Create detailed migration plan for the first feature (NPCs)
3. Establish architectural guidelines and linting rules
4. Begin incremental migration with comprehensive testing
