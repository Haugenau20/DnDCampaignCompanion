 * Voice: say what the page is *for*, in the language of someone at the table.
 * Every blurb here used to end with a variant of "each campaign is visible
 * only to the group that plays it", and `notes` opened by explaining who
 * could not read it -- true, but nobody wonders. Players already assume a
 * campaign is theirs and their notes are theirs; spelling out the access
 * model reads like a tour of the back of the application rather than a
 * reason to come in. Nor does anything here name the DM: a group admin is
 * as likely to be a player, and the record works whether or not the DM ever
