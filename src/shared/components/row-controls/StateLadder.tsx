/*
 * There was a `selectedClassName` here, and `15-4` removed it rather than
 * fixing its spelling. Three things were wrong with it at once:
 *
 * 1. **No option ever named a class that exists.** The location and rumour
 *    ladders asked for `knowledge-0/1/2` and the quest ladder for
 *    `outcome-completed` / `outcome-failed`; no stylesheet defines any of the
 *    five. `css-class-manifest.test.ts` walks defined-but-unapplied and
 *    deliberately not the reverse -- that direction would report every Tailwind
 *    utility in the product -- so a class name passed as *data* had no gate at
 *    all, and the ladders looked right because `chip-toggle-selected` was doing
 *    the work.
 * 2. **It could not have worked anyway.** `.chip-toggle-selected` sets `color`
 *    and is declared later in `components.css` than `.valence-*`, so at equal
 *    specificity it wins whatever the option asks for.
 * 3. **The reference does not ask for it.** `S2`, `S4` and `S8` all draw the
 *    selected step as the same chip, because a ladder is a control and the
 *    selected chip says "this is the current one" -- not what the state means.
 *    The state's own hue belongs to the *word* in the row, which is
 *    `RosterStatus` and the valence ramp.

   * `--accent-ink`, which the colour schema solves against page, card and
   * sunken and **not** against the band (~1.9:1, T040). On the band the chip
   * takes the band's own neutral pair, which is what the reference shows.

/**
 * A short ladder of states, changed in one click from the row.
 *
 * Three or four buttons, never a dropdown: these are the fields people
 * currently open a whole form to change -- a quest's status, an NPC's stance, a
 * location's or a rumour's knowledge step. The mocks (`S2`, `S6`, `S8`) show
 * buttons for exactly this reason.
 *
 * Every step is a **word** as well as a colour (design language §2), and the
 * write obeys §7: the button that is lit is the one the *record* holds, not
 * the one just clicked, until the server agrees.
