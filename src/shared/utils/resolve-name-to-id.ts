 * Turn a name the extractor produced into an id the product can store.
 *
 * The extraction model has never seen the NPC directory or the location tree,
 * so everything relational it returns is prose: `parentLocation` is "The
 * Shire", and a quest's people are names. Those were written straight into
 * id-shaped fields — `Location.parentId`, `Quest.relatedNPCIds` — where every
 * consumer looked them up and found nothing, and where a dangling `parentId`
 * additionally filed the new place under "Unplaced".
 *
 * **A single exact match wins; anything else returns an empty string.** Both
 * failure modes — no match, and more than one — fail closed, because a wrong
 * link is worse than an absent one. An absent link is visible and one action
 * to fix; a wrong one silently asserts a connection the session never made.
 * Creating a record for an unmatched name was considered and rejected: one
 * misspelling would become a permanent duplicate place.
 *
 * Matching is trimmed and case-insensitive, because a model varies both
 * freely, but never partial — "Shire" must not match "The Shire", or a name
 * would link to whichever record happened to contain the word.
