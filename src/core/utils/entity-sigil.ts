// Deterministic identity marks for campaign entities.
//
// The same NPC or location should look like itself everywhere it appears --
// lists, activity, quests, notes -- so a mark is derived from the entity's id
// rather than stored. That costs one function and a palette instead of any art,
// and it is what makes a long list scannable rather than uniform.

/**
 * How many distinct hues a mark can take.
 *
 * Deliberately a constant rather than `palette.length`. If the index were
 * `hash % palette.length`, appending a ninth hue would renumber every entity in
 * the campaign at once -- every mark in the product would change colour on
 * deploy. With a fixed count, appending an entry is inert until this constant is
 * raised, which makes growing the palette a visible decision instead of a
 * side effect. Reordering the palette still changes existing marks; that is the
 * documented trade and why order is part of the contract.
 *
 * Themes must define at least this many palette entries.
