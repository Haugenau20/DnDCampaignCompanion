/**
 * The space where an entity's image goes.
 *
 * **Empty is the common state**, and it has to look deliberate: most slots
 * will be empty for most entities for the life of a campaign, and a slot that
 * only looks right once someone uploads something looks wrong almost always.
 * Diagonal ruling in the page's own sunken tone reads as reserved space with a
 * design. A stock illustration would read as a wrong picture.
 *
 * Filled, the picture covers the frame the caller sized. The stored image is
 * uncropped and carries its own size, so any frame shape just crops it, and
 * the width and height attributes reserve the space before the bytes arrive.
 *
 * An image whose URL is not a download URL for this app's own bucket is
 * treated as absent: a member can write any string into a document, and a
 * planted third-party URL would log everyone who opens the page.
 *
 * Adding, replacing and removing is `ImageUploadControl`'s job; this only
 * shows what is there.
