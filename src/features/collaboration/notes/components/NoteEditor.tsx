          reads with a clear truncation mark, and clicking in to edit reveals
          the whole value. Without it the title clips mid-letter

          text exists. This covers explicit titles too, which are uncapped.

          used to call it "the last hand-rolled textarea element in the
          product"; it was not. `ContactForm` in `src/shared/components` had
          one too, and 09-2's gate grepped only `src/features` and
          `src/pages` -- accurate about what it checked, wrong about what it
          was taken to prove. Converted in 10-3, with the gate rewritten to
          cover `src`. The visible label
          comes with it: the control was already named for a screen reader by
          its `aria-label`, so that attribute goes rather than sitting on top
          of a real label element and shadowing it.
