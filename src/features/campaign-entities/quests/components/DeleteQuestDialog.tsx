 * Deleting a quest, asked once, naming what else loses a link.
 *
 * A quest is the most linked-to record in the product: rumours convert into
 * it, locations and NPCs relate to it, notes mention it. Deleting one is
 * therefore never a local act, and "This cannot be undone" -- all the dialog it
 * replaces said -- describes the wrong risk. Phase 14 §6: name the object and
 * the blast radius.
 *
 * It lives on the quest's page rather than in the directory row (`15-5` item
 * 12). A row is read while scanning five of them, and the destructive control
 * for a record should sit beside the record, not in the list of them.
