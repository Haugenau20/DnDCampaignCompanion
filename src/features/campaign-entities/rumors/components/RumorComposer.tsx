/**
 * Why the disabled button explains itself.
 *
 * *Add rumour* is disabled until the field has something in it, which is
 * correct and which read as broken: the maintainer's first encounter with this
 * row was pressing the button, getting nothing, and concluding it did not
 * work. A disabled control that says nothing is indistinguishable from one
 * that is simply not wired up.
 *
 * Chrome does not show a `title` on a disabled button -- pointer events are
 * suppressed on it -- so the tooltip belongs to the *wrapper*, and the same
 * sentence is bound to the button through `aria-describedby` for anyone who
 * cannot hover.

/**
 * The composer row, permanently at the top of the list (item 1).
 *
 * A rumour is the one thing in this product you write down *while someone is
 * still talking*. Everything else can wait for a form; this cannot, and until
 * now it took a route change to `/rumors/create`, a seven-field form and a
 * navigation back to the list to record one sentence overheard in a tavern.
 *
 * **The field is what was heard, not a title.** It took the title until the
 * maintainer pointed out the obvious: a title worth typing is a sentence, and
 * a sentence never fits the row that has to render it — so the one thing you
 * wrote while someone was still talking was the one thing you could not read
 * back. What you type is now the rumour's *content*, and the list names the
 * row from its first line until you give it a shorter title on purpose.
 *
 * Write it, press Add, and the new rumour's row opens underneath with the
 * title field focused — the sentence is already recorded, so the only thing
 * left is to name it, and that can wait. **No dialog and no navigation** —
 * there is no page to land on, which is the whole design of this entity
 * (§2.1).
 *
 * Deliberately not `15-1`'s quick add: that opens a dialog and then sends you
 * to the record's own page, and a rumour has neither. The one-field shape is
 * the same idea in the place this entity actually lives.
