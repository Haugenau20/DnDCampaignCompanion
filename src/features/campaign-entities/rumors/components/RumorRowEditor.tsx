 *
 * - **The typed fields** (title, what was heard, who exactly) are a draft with
 *   a Save, because they are one thought and half of it is not worth writing.
 * - **The ladder and the trays** write immediately, because each is a single
 *   act with its own result, and because "confirm this rumour" must be one
