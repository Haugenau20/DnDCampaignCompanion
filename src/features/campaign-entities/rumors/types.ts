   * Where the rumour came from, or **absent because nobody has said**.

   * `'other'`, which made the row print "Other" for a record whose source had
   * never been discussed -- and left the editor showing no chip selected, so
   * the two contradicted each other. `'other'` is now a real answer meaning
   * "none of the other four", chosen deliberately; "nobody said" is this field
   * being missing, and the row prints an em dash for it.
   *
   * Records written before this change all carry `'other'` and cannot be told
   * apart from a deliberate choice, so they keep reading "Other" -- exactly
   * what they did before. There is no migration; the app reads the data it has.
   *
   * **`null`, not `undefined`, once a reader has cleared one.** This project
   * builds Firestore with a bare `getFirestore()` and no
   * `ignoreUndefinedProperties`, so an update carrying `undefined` throws
   * rather than clearing the field -- which is why `sourceNpcId` next door is
   * written as `''`. A rumour created without a source simply omits the key;
   * one whose source is un-picked stores `null`. Every reader tests
   * falsiness, so the three absences behave identically.
