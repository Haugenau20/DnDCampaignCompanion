 *   (`useCampaignCollectionPath`), so the batch lands in the campaign the
 *   action was taken in (T082); `null` when there is no campaign
 * @param plural - how the error names the records, e.g. `'NPCs'`
 * @param writes - the writes; an empty list commits nothing
 * @throws when there are more writes than one batch can hold
