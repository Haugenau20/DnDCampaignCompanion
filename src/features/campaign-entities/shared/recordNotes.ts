 *
 * They lived in an array inside the record, so every note rewrote the whole
 * record, went again to every listener, and grew it towards Firestore's 1 MiB,
 * after which every write to the record failed (F3); and no rule could cap a
 * note's text inside the array (F4). As documents, each is written alone and
 * capped alone, and a record's notes are read only where they are shown.
 *
 * The old array is read beside them until `scripts/migrate-records.js` has
 * moved it; a note from the array is edited and deleted where it is, a note
 * from its own document through these.
