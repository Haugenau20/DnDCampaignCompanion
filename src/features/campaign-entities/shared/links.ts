/**
 * Where every link between two records is stored, and how each side reads it
 * (T131; `docs/architecture/data-model-review.md`, F1).
 *
 * **Each link has one owner field**, and the other side derives it, the way a
 * rumour's people always worked. A link added on either page lands in the
 * owner, so both pages show it:
 *
 * | Link | Owner |
 * |---|---|
 * | person ↔ quest | `Quest.relatedNPCIds` |
 * | person ↔ place | `Location.connectedNPCs` (a person may be in several) |
 * | place ↔ quest | `Quest.locationId`, `Quest.keyLocations[].locationId` |
 * | rumour → place | `Rumor.locationId` (where it was heard) and `Rumor.relatedLocations` |
 * | person ↔ person | `NPC.connections.relatedNPCs`, on either one, once |
 * | rumour → person | `Rumor.relatedNPCs` |
 *
 * Three links were once stored on both records: `NPC.connections.relatedQuests`,
 * `NPC.locationId` and `Location.relatedQuests` were second halves.
 * `scripts/migrate-links.js` merged them into the owners in production and
 * cleared them, and nothing reads or writes them any more. A rumour's two
 * place fields are not halves of one link: both live on the rumour, the
 * directory groups by the first, and both are read together. Ids that resolve
 * to no record are left for the reader to drop, as every reader already does.
