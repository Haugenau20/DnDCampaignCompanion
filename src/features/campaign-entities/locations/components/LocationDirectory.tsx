/**
 * The locations directory: a tree of rows.
 *
 * **What this replaces.** A parent used to expand into a full record card —
 * nine labelled fields, two action buttons — then print a "Locations in X"
 * heading, then nest a *child record card* inside it. Two records at identical
 * weight, nested, unbounded as depth grows. Design language §5 is the principle
 * that breaks: rules inside a card read as one object with parts, and cards
 * inside cards read as two objects arguing about which one is the record.
 *
 * **What it becomes** (§6.1): every place is one line until asked — mark, name,
 * type in words, knowledge step and what is inside. Asking is clicking the
 * row, at every depth and whether or not anything is inside it; the way to the
 * place's own page is *More info*, in the expansion (D41). Expanding adds the
 * bounded summary from §3 and then lists what is inside as more one-line rows,
 * so a child expanded inside an expanded parent still reads as one object with
 * parts. The row is *not* emptied: §1.3 records the first draft that moved
 * every readable fact to the page, and why it was rejected.
 *
 * **Every traversal here is guarded.** `location-tree.ts` carries the visited
 * sets and the depth cap. `15-4` makes cycles reachable — *Move elsewhere* on
 * the page can now write a parent — so a tree render that does not terminate is
 * no longer a hypothetical (`PERF-11`, T033).
