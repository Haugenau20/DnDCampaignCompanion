 * free-text `location` is only ever shown, never looked up:
 * 1. `locationId` set and resolves to a Location -> that Location's current
 *    `name`, so a rename shows everywhere the place is referenced.
 * 2. Otherwise the free text, exactly as written. "Somewhere in Mirkwood" is
 *    what a player wrote, and it stays visible.
 * 3. No free text either, but a `locationId` that names nothing -> that id,
 *    verbatim.
 * 4. Neither field set -> `undefined`, so callers keep their own
 *    "Location unknown" / "--" fallback rather than this function inventing
 *    one.
 *
 * Returning an unresolved reference untouched (steps 2 and 3) is the
 * deliberate part (#1412). A reference to a location that no longer exists
 * has to stay visible as itself rather than be dressed up as something real
 * -- title-casing a slug would invent a place, and would silently diverge
 * from the real name the moment anyone renamed one (#303, #009).
 *
 * The free text used to be matched against the campaign's places too, by id
 * and then by name, for documents written before `locationId` existed. None
 * is left in production: those documents were given their `locationId` on
 * 2026-10-08 (T079, `firebase/functions/scripts/audit-location-ids.js`).
