/**
 * Rumors index.
 *
 * `RumorDirectory` carries the progress bar, the category chips, the search
 * field and bulk-select. Rendering it over an empty array — which is what the
 * signed-out page used to do — put five controls on screen that could not act,
 * which reads as broken rather than as gated. `GatedContent` renders it only
 * in the `ready` state.
 *
 * It carries no *Add Rumor* action: `15-7` put a composer at the top of the
 * list, and a second way in that leaves for `/rumors/create` would be the
 * page contradicting the control directly below it.
