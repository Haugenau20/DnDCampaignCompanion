/**
 * Notes index.
 *
 * Uses the `notes` page key, whose `requires` is `"campaign"` — `NoteContext`
 * sets `filteredNotes = []` whenever there is no `activeCampaignId` ("If no
 * active campaign, show no notes"), so a member with a group but no campaign
 * chosen has nothing to read and belongs on the campaign picker, not here.
 * (This page used to gate on `"group"` alone, on the mistaken belief that
 * `NoteContext` only *filtered* by campaign rather than discarding everything
 * without one.)
 *
 * The header action is additionally gated on `activeCampaignId`, which is now
 * redundant with the page-level gate above but kept as a direct guard on the
 * write path itself.
