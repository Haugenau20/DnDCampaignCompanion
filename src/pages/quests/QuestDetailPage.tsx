 * with a row highlighted, because there was nowhere else to send them. A rumour
 * could be converted into a quest and then not refer to it.

 * complications, rewards and the level range are read once, while prepping --
 * which is when you are here -- and they are what made the expanded quest row
 * about 1,100px tall (§3). The row keeps the four facts you can read while
 * scanning five of them; everything else lives here, in full and not behind a
 * reveal.
 *
 * **What this page deliberately does not do**, all three of which `S3` draws:
 *
 * - No per-objective history. The reference prints "gandlaf ticked *Find the
 *   secret door* · last session"; `ContentAttribution` holds created-by and
 *   last-modified-by and **nothing in between** (§8). A line like that
 *   would be inventing a history the data does not carry.
 * - No per-field credit under the description, for the same reason.
 * - No second NPC list. `importantNPCs` is deleted (`D15.7`) -- two fields for
 *   one relationship, both rendered, is why Thorin and Smaug appeared twice on
 *   the same card.
