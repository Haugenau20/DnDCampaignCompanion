Prioritized Todo List

2. REWORK of HomePage
- Dashboard layout being implemented
    - Implement/review proper highlighting logic to pages.
    - The medieval theme does not work with the hamburger menu and theme selector dropdown.

3. When adding a new chapter it says that the chapter summary is optional, but it won't create the chapter if there is no summary.
- Either make it truly optional or make it mandatory and show an error if not typed in.

4. Right now it is possible to type in parent location that dont exist when creating a location. This should not be possible.

5. Fix mobile layout issues on certain pages. (Big update)

6. User should be able to change their password.

7. Have registration tokens expire after X days

8. Filter tabs look different on the location page than the other pages.

9. "Add note" and "Edit" button clashes rn

10. Right now some dialogs are on top of the local container. Instead they should be on top of the underlying document body.

11. Make completed quests be default hidden with option to expand?

12. Make active quests be on the top of the list?

13. Fix/Implement proper searching

14. Add batch options (Delete, change status, etc.) for Story, Quest, NPC, and Location features


Waiting for prio:

- F12 console Error in StoryContext when it is trying to update "current-progress"
    - I think this is a remnant of purposefully unused functionality and it should just be deleted. 

Admin Panel:
- Test if the creation of new groups and campaigns work
- Right now the "groups" view only shows the current group. 
- Campaigns can be created. 
- groups cannot be created
- neither campaigns or groups can be edited.
- campaigns cannot be deleted.

Rework the theme system to collect as much functionality as possible.
- Simplify the amount of different colors.

New feature idea (partly implemented already): sub-chapters.
