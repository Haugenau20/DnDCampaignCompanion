Prioritized Todo List

5. Fix mobile layout issues on certain pages. (Big update)

6. User should be able to change their password.

7. Have registration tokens expire after X days

10. Right now some dialogs are on top of the local container. Instead they should be on top of the underlying document body.

11. Make completed quests be default hidden with option to expand?

12. Make active quests be on the top of the list?

13. Fix/Implement proper searching

14. Add batch options (Delete, change status, etc.) for Story, Quest, NPC, and Location features


Waiting for prio:

- Lots of dates are invalid.

- Bookshelf view has some odd color differences.

- Implement/review proper highlighting logic to pages.

- F12 console Error in StoryContext when it is trying to update "current-progress"
    - I think this is a remnant of purposefully unused functionality and it should just be deleted. 
    - It seems to be deeply embedded in the codebase. Remove it entirely all around.

Admin Panel:
- Test if the creation of new groups and campaigns work
- Right now the "groups" view only shows the current group. 
- Campaigns can be created. 
- groups cannot be created
- neither campaigns or groups can be edited.
- campaigns cannot be deleted.

Rework the theme system to collect as much functionality as possible.
- Simplify the amount of different colors.

New feature idea (partly implemented already): sub-chapters.

Major do-over of the project structure
