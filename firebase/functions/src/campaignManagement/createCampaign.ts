 * Campaigns used to be created by the browser under the rules, which cannot
 * count, so nothing bounded how many a group had. This counts them in the
 * same transaction that creates one: a group holds at most
 * `MAX_GROUP_CAMPAIGNS`, two members racing for the last place cannot both
 * have it, and deleting a campaign (`deleteCampaign`) gives its place back,
 * since a deleted campaign is no longer there to count.
 *
 * Every member may create one (decided 2026-10-08), as the rules allowed; a
 * member is someone whose profile lists the group, as the rules'
 * `isGroupMember` reads it. Not while the group is being deleted (T037).
 *
 * The id is the name's slug, or the slug and a random suffix when that is
 * taken, and the creator's active campaign becomes the new one.
