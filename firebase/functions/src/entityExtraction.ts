 * The model this function calls, and the only one it will call.
 *
 * This used to be `request.data.model`, defaulting to `gpt-3.5-turbo` -- a
 * value chosen in the browser and passed to OpenAI unchecked. A modified
 * client could name any model on the price list against this project's key,
 * bounded only by the daily counter below, so the ceiling on a compromised
 * account was roughly an order of magnitude above what the limits implied.
 * The model is not a caller's decision: it is a cost and quality decision that
 * belongs to the deployment, so it is pinned here and the request field is
 * gone rather than merely ignored.
 *
 * **Why `gpt-4.1-mini`** (T050), replacing `gpt-3.5-turbo`. Its headline output
 * rate is $1.60/1M against $1.50, which reads like a rise and is not one: this
 * call is dominated by *input* -- the ~1,500-token function schema below plus
 * the system prompt, on every request, against a note capped at 10,000
 * characters -- and input drops from $0.50 to $0.40. The schema is a fixed
 * prefix comfortably over OpenAI's 1,024-token caching minimum, so it bills at
 * the $0.10 cached rate; `gpt-3.5-turbo` had no cached rate at all. A
 * representative call is cheaper before caching and materially cheaper after.
 * **Do not re-open this from the output column alone.**
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** a `gpt-5`-family or o-series model. Those reject a
 * non-default `temperature` on chat completions, so adopting one would mean
 * dropping the `temperature: 0` below -- and determinism is worth keeping in an
 * extractor whose output is written straight into campaign records.

        Structured Outputs, not the legacy `functions` array.

        This was a `functions` / `function_call` pair, deprecated since 2023 in
        favour of `tools` / `tool_choice`, and with it the schema below was only
        ever a *hint*: the model was free to return a shape that did not match,
        and several of T050's losses are exactly that -- a field arriving in a
        form the consumer did not expect. `strict: true` makes the schema a
        guarantee instead, which is worth more here than anywhere else in the
        product, because what comes back is written into campaign records.

        Three things strict mode requires, each of which changed something:
          - `anyOf`, never `oneOf`. The four entity variants used `oneOf`,
            which strict mode rejects outright.
          - every property listed in `required`. Optionality is expressed as a
            nullable type instead, so the model must *say* it found no race
            rather than quietly omitting the key. Consumers already treat null
            and absent alike (`extraData.race || undefined`), so this is a
            schema change with no behaviour change downstream.
          - `enum: ["npc"]` rather than `const: "npc"` for the discriminators.
