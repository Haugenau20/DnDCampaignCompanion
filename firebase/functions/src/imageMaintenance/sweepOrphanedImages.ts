 * the daily run reads only the ledgers (`sweepReleasedImages`), and this one
 * finds what they never recorded: files from before the ledgers, and the
 * leftovers of a write from a frontend that did not record them.
 *
 * Image writes are ordered so a failure can leave a file without a document,
 * never a document without its file (`shared/hooks/useImageAttachment.ts` in
 * the web app). This removes those leftovers: an upload whose document write
 * failed, the old file of a replace, the file of a removed image or a deleted
 * NPC or location whose follow-up delete failed.
 *
 * The references are read before the files are listed. A file uploaded in
 * between is under a day old, so the age guard keeps it. An older file is
 * kept while a live `pendingUploads` entry names it: its document write may
 * still be queued in an offline tab (T084).

 * listing stops once the run has found as many orphans as it may delete, and
