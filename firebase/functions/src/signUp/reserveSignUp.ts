 * Called from the join page, anonymously, before the visitor signs in with a
 * magic link or Google. It checks the invitation -- exists, unused, unexpired
 * -- and records a reservation that `gateAccountCreation` looks for when Auth
 * is about to create the account. It spends nothing: the invitation is only
 * spent by `redeemInvitation`, once the account exists.
 *
 * Harmless for somebody who already has an account -- signing in creates
 * nothing, so the reservation is simply never used and expires.
 *
 * The account cap is checked here too, not only in the gate, so that a full
 * project says so on the join page instead of after the visitor has gone to
 * their inbox and back.
