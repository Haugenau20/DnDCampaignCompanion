// What the two halves of the sign-up gate share: `reserveSignUp`, which a
// visitor holding an invitation calls before any account exists, and
// `gateAccountCreation`, which Firebase Auth calls before it creates one.
//
// Why the gate needs two halves: a blocking function sees only the account
// about to be created -- its email, its provider -- and nothing the client
// sent alongside. There is no way to hand it an invitation token. So the token
// is checked first, by a callable, and what the callable leaves behind is a
// reservation keyed to the email the visitor said they would use. The blocking
// function then admits exactly the emails that hold one.
