// Founder invitations (T125): how a table that has never used the site gets
// in without the maintainer setting its group up. One admits one account,
// which may then create one group (`createGroup` spends it, T126). They are
// issued by the maintainer, on the operator page (T137) or with
// `scripts/issue-founder-invitation.js`, through the Admin SDK: the app grants
// nobody the power to issue them (the onboarding plan, D6).
